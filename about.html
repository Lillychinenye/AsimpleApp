<div> <p>My expectation is, but not limited to, Networking, Portfolio growth as well as improvement on my skill.
I want to be able to meet others who are as passionate about the programming journey to be accountability and growth partners.
I want to be able to build several projects to add and grow my portfolio thereby making me appealing in the job search.
Lastly and most importantly, I want to gather as much knowledge to help with programming due diligence as well improve in every aspect.

I hope I will be able to tick off each expectation  from the bucket list  at the end of the program</p>
